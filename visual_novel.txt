Now, a new Pilot arrives at the hangar.
The fate of the market is in your hands.
Prepare yourself, Pilot... calibration begins now.

SYSTEM: Detecting organic life signs... Neural sync starting in 3... 2... 1...

R.O.B.B.I.E. 9000: Ah, finally. A new <b>'organic'</b> in the pilot seat. How many cycles have I waited in this silent hangar? <span class='text-yellow-400'>Dusty and boring.</span>

R.O.B.B.I.E. 9000: My name is <b>R.O.B.B.I.E. 9000</b>. I am the tactical brain of this ship. And you... you are the Pilot. Don't be so tense, I can feel your irregular heartbeat through the biometric seat sensors.

R.O.B.B.I.E. 9000: Emergency scenario initiated: Your ship was just hit by a <b>DeFi meteor storm</b>. The main reactor is leaking energy! Ship power is <b class='text-rose-500'>dropping by 20%</b> in seconds. If you stay still, we'll go dark. What's your protocol, Pilot?
[Option] Eject Protocol - "Secure what remains."
[Option] Stabilize Reactor - "Measured risk."
[Option] Overload Engine! - "Double Down!"

R.O.B.B.I.E. 9000: Where does your adrenaline trigger? Hunting small meteors flashing by in hours <b class='text-cyan-400'>(Blitz)</b>, or waiting for a massive supernova that takes days to ripen <b class='text-rose-500'>(Orbit)</b>?
[Option] Blitz Hunt - "Instant results."
[Option] Await Supernova - "Explorer's patience."

R.O.B.B.I.E. 9000: One last thing, Pilot. In the Alphabit armory, we have two types of warheads. Which one do you feel is more 'powerful'?
[Option] 'Moon' Missile (Call) - "Fly to the stars."
[Option] 'Doom' Nuke (Put) - "Watch the market burn."
